libdbd-sqlite3-perl (1.50-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  From upstream changes:

    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Updated to SQLite 3.10.0.
      Because of the addition of LIKE/GLOB/REGEXP support on
      virtual tables, previous ::PerlData virtual table got broken.
      This is hopefully fixed by adding strlike/strglob functions
      to DBD::SQLite but if you use this virtual table, please
      test it carefully.
    - Now you can make a database connection read-only if you
      turn on the ReadOnly attribute when you connect. (RT #110439)
      If you set it after you connect to a database, DBD::SQLite
      warns because the database doesn't actually become read-only.

  From upstream changes:

    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Changed to apply quotemeta() to parameters while building

libdbd-sqlite3-perl (1.44-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  From upstream changes:

    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Resolved #96877: sql statements should be converted to utf8 (DAMI)
      If you set sqlite_unicode to true, SQL statements will be upgraded
      to avoid inconsistency between embedded params and bind params.

libdbd-sqlite3-perl (1.40-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream changes:

    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Resolved #56444: immediate transaction should be on by
      default, and the doc be updated.
      If you really need the deferred transaction (which had long
      been the default), set sqlite_use_immediate_transaction
      to false explicitly. (ISHIGAKI)

libdbd-sqlite3-perl (1.37-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream changes:

    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Updated to SQLite 3.7.10 (ISHIGAKI)
      Note that this release changed the default schema format
      number, that means newly created database files will be
      unreadable by SQLite version prior to 3.3.0 (2006-01-10)
      (or DBD::SQLite prior to 1.12) unless you explicitly issue
      "PRAGMA legacy_file_format=ON".

libdbd-sqlite3-perl (1.35-1) unstable; urgency=low

  From upstream changes:

    *** CHANGES THAT MAY POSSIBLY BREAK YOUR OLD APPLICATIONS ***
    - Resolved #67581: bind_param SQL_INTEGER numifies value;
      Now DBD::SQLite croaks if you explicitly specify datatype
      (with bind_param) and datatype mismatch happens (ISHIGAKI)
    - Datatype set in the bind_param(_array) becomes sticky now
      (as per DBI spec). This potentially affects code depending on
      current undocumented and broken behavior. (Yuriy Kaminskiy)

libdbd-sqlite3-perl (1.31-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The following changes may break older applications:

  * Fix corruption of BLOB data stored in utf8 columns; this data
    is now stored as bytes even if the flag is set (RT#54721)

libdbd-sqlite3-perl (1.27-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The following changes may break older applications:

  * Development releases (never uploaded to Debian) saw some changes
    with foreign key support. Foreign key support was enabled by
    default but broke a lot of things, so is now disabled once again.
    Please note that support may be enabled upstream in sqlite itself
    so things that break should be fixed.

    In the meantime, you can enable foreign keys with:
      PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON
  * Remove undocumented reset method (use $sth->finish instead)
  * Fix $dbh->column_info to work according to the DBI spec (RT#49716)
  * Fix $sth->primary_key_info to work according to DBI spec
